#  Design for API Gateway Cluster

When the service grows and the API Gateway is deployed in a cluster model, the following design considerations should be taken into account to ensure efficient rate limiting across multiple instances:

### Key Components:
1. **API Gateway Cluster**: Multiple instances of the API Gateway to handle increased traffic and provide high availability.
2. **Distributed Rate Limiting**: Using a centralized data store like Redis to share rate limit state across all instances.
3. **Centralized Logging and Monitoring (Optional)**: Tools like ELK Stack, Prometheus, and Grafana for logging and monitoring.
4. **Load Balancer**: To distribute incoming requests across the API Gateway instances.
5. **Data Store for Rate Limiting**: Redis for fast read and write operations and atomic counters.

### High-Level Design:

```
             +------------------------+
             |      Load Balancer     |
             +-----------+------------+
                         |
         +---------------+----------------+
         |               |                |
+--------+-------+ +-----+--------+ +------+--------+
|  API Gateway 1 | |  API Gateway 2| |  API Gateway 3|
+--------+-------+ +-----+--------+ +------+--------+
         |               |                |
         +---------------+----------------+
                         |
                 +-------+-------+
                 |   Redis Cluster  |
                 +-------+-------+
                         |
              +----------+----------+
              |       Data Store       |
              +------------------------+
```

### Detailed Steps:

#### 1. Setting Up the API Gateway Cluster:
- Deploy multiple instances of your API Gateway service using orchestration tool like Docker swarm, Kubernetes,..
- Ensure each instance can scale up or down based on traffic.

#### 2. Implementing Distributed Rate Limiting:
- Use a Redis cluster to store rate limiting counters.
- Each API Gateway instance will check and update rate limits in Redis.

#### 3. Centralized Logging and Monitoring: (optional)
- Set up a centralized logging system like ELK Stack.
- Collect logs and metrics from all API Gateway instances.
- Use Prometheus for monitoring metrics and Grafana for visualizing them.

#### 4. Configuring the Load Balancer:
- Use Nginx, HAProxy, or a cloud-based load balancer to distribute traffic.
- Configure health checks to ensure traffic is only sent to healthy instances.

#### 5. Setting Up the Data Store:
- Set up a Redis cluster for high availability and scalability.
- Ensure Redis is configured to handle high traffic loads.

### Benefits of this Design:
1. **Scalability**: The system can handle increased traffic by scaling the number of API Gateway instances.
2. **High Availability**: If one instance goes down, others can continue to handle requests.
3. **Consistent Rate Limiting**: Using Redis ensures that rate limits are consistently enforced across all instances.
4. **Centralized Management**: Logging and monitoring systems provide centralized management of the distributed system.
